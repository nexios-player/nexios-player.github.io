PRIVACY POLICY
Last Updated: January 3, 2026

1. DATA MINIMIZATION PRINCIPLE
Nexios and Nexios Player are designed to be "privacy-first." We do not operate central servers that store your streaming habits or credentials.

2. INFORMATION WE DO NOT COLLECT
- We do NOT collect your IPTV credentials (usernames/passwords).
- We do NOT track which channels or movies you watch.
- We do NOT sell your data to third parties.

3. DATA STORED ON-DEVICE
The following data is stored locally on your device (and may sync via your private iCloud if enabled):
- Playlist URLs and Xtream credentials.
- SMB network paths and login tokens.
- Favorites, "Continue Watching" history, and local metadata cache.

4. NETWORK ACCESS & THIRD PARTIES
When you play a stream, the App connects directly to your provider. 
- Your IP Address: Is visible to your content provider, not us.
- Local Network: The App requests local network permission only to facilitate SMB/File sharing connections.
- Metadata: We may fetch posters/descriptions from third-party APIs (e.g., TMDB). These requests are anonymous.

5. 2026 DATA RIGHTS (CCPA/GDPR/GPC)
- We honor "Global Privacy Control" (GPC) signals. 
- Since we store no identifiable data on our servers, there is no data to "delete" or "export" from our side; deleting the App removes all local data.

6. CHILDREN’S PRIVACY
The App is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
