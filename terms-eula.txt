This Agreement is a legal contract between you and the developer of Nexios and Nexios Player (collectively, the "App"). By using the App on iOS, macOS, or tvOS, you agree to these terms and the Apple Standard EULA.

2. NEUTRAL PLAYER DISCLOSURE (IMPORTANT)
The App is a technical tool for playing media. The App does NOT provide, host, or distribute any media content, IPTV subscriptions, M3U playlists, or streaming credentials. 
- You, the User, are 100% responsible for the legality of the content you access.
- The App does not have any affiliation with third-party content providers.
- We do not "check" or "verify" the legality of your M3U, Xtream, or SMB sources.

3. COPYRIGHT & INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

4. USER-PROVIDED CONNECTIONS (SMB/M3U/XTREAM)
By adding a source (M3U, Xtream Codes, or SMB/Local Network), you represent that you have the legal right to access that data. The App merely provides the interface to view it.

- Age Assurance: This App relies on Apple’s Declared Age Range API. Access may be restricted based on the age signals provided by your Apple Account.
